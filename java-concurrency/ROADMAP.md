## Phase 1 — Foundations: Threads and the Java Memory Model

Master how threads are born, run, and die. Build the correct mental model of Java's memory visibility guarantees before touching any synchronization primitive.

### 1.1 Thread Fundamentals
| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `threads/ThreadCreationDemo.java` | Thread vs Runnable vs Callable vs lambda; daemon threads; thread naming |
| `threads/ThreadLifecycleDemo.java` | All 6 states (NEW → RUNNABLE → BLOCKED/WAITING/TIMED_WAITING → TERMINATED) with real transitions |
| `threads/ThreadLocalDemo.java` | Thread-confined state; memory leak pattern in thread pools; InheritableThreadLocal |

### 1.2 Java Memory Model
| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `synchronization/VolatileDemo.java` | CPU cache vs main memory; volatile visibility guarantee; why `count++` is NOT safe with volatile |

**Theory:** `threads/Threads_Theory.md`

**Interview checkpoint:** Explain happens-before, visibility vs atomicity, and why `volatile` alone cannot make `count++` thread-safe.

---

## Phase 2 — Synchronization and Locking

Move from raw `synchronized` blocks through the full `java.util.concurrent.locks` spectrum. Understand deadlocks — how they happen and how to prevent them.

### 2.1 Intrinsic Locks (synchronized)
| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `synchronization/SynchronizationDemo.java` | synchronized method vs block; fine-grained locking; lock on wrong object pitfall |
| `synchronization/ConditionDemo.java` | `BoundedBuffer` with `Condition.await/signal`; thundering herd; `BetterBlockingQueue` with executor |

### 2.2 Explicit Locks
| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `locks/LockDemo.java` | Intrinsic vs explicit lock comparison |
| `locks/ReentrantLockDemo.java` | `tryLock`, timed lock, `lockInterruptibly`, fairness |
| `locks/ReadWriteLockDemo.java` | Multiple readers / single writer; downgrade allowed, upgrade not |
| `locks/StampedLockDemo.java` | Optimistic reads; `validate(stamp)`; NOT reentrant |

### 2.3 Concurrency Hazards
| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `synchronization/DeadlockDemo.java` | Deliberate deadlock; lock ordering avoidance; tryLock timeout avoidance; programmatic detection via ThreadMXBean |

**Theory:** `synchronization/Synchronization_Theory.md`, `locks/Locks_Theory.md`

**Interview checkpoint:** Implement a thread-safe bounded buffer using `ReentrantLock + Condition`. Explain why `signal()` is better than `notifyAll()` here.
