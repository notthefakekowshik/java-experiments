/**
 * Synchronization Demo - Thread Safety with synchronized keyword
 *
 * INTERVIEW PREP - Key Topics:
 * =============================
 * 1. What is the synchronized keyword and when to use it?
 *    - Provides mutual exclusion (mutex) lock
 *    - Only one thread can execute synchronized code at a time
 *    - Prevents race conditions on shared mutable state
 *    - Can be applied to methods or blocks
 *
 * 2. Common Interview Questions:
 *    - Difference between synchronized method vs synchronized block?
 *    - What is the lock object in synchronized(this)?
 *    - Can two threads execute different synchronized methods simultaneously? (No, if on same instance)
 *    - Synchronized on static method vs instance method?
 *    - What is monitor/intrinsic lock in Java?
 *    - Explain happens-before relationship
 *    - What is reentrant locking?
 *
 * 3. Synchronized Method vs Block:
 *    - Synchronized method: Locks entire method (lock on 'this' for instance methods)
 *    - Synchronized block: Locks only critical section (better performance)
 *    - Block allows choosing lock object explicitly
 *
 * 4. Static vs Instance Synchronization:
 *    - Instance synchronized: Lock on object instance (this)
 *    - Static synchronized: Lock on Class object (ClassName.class)
 *    - Different locks, can execute simultaneously
 *
 * 5. Best Practices:
 *    - Minimize synchronized scope (use blocks, not methods)
 *    - Avoid synchronizing on public objects
 *    - Consider using concurrent collections
 *    - Use ReentrantLock for advanced features (tryLock, timed locks)
 *    - Don't synchronize on String literals or boxed primitives
 *
 * 6. Common Pitfalls:
 *    - Forgetting to synchronize all access to shared state
 *    - Deadlocks (circular lock dependencies)
 *    - Performance degradation from over-synchronization
 *    - Synchronizing on wrong object
