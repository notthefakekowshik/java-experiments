/**
 * StampedLock Demo - Advanced Locking with Optimistic Reads
 *
 * INTERVIEW PREP - Key Topics:
 * =============================
 * 1. What is StampedLock?
 *    - A lock with three modes: writing, reading, and optimistic reading.
 *    - It returns a "stamp" (a long value) that is used to validate locks or unlock.
 *    - Not reentrant. A thread cannot acquire the same lock twice.
 *
 * 2. StampedLock vs. ReadWriteLock:
 *    - StampedLock offers an "optimistic read" mode, which is very fast but doesn't block writers.
 *    - ReadWriteLock can lead to writer starvation if there are many readers. StampedLock's design can offer better throughput in read-heavy scenarios.
 *    - StampedLock is more complex to use correctly.
 *
 * 3. Three Modes of Operation:
 *    - `writeLock()`: Exclusive lock. Blocks all other threads. Returns a stamp for unlocking.
 *    - `readLock()`: Non-exclusive lock. Blocks writers but allows other readers. Returns a stamp for unlocking.
 *    - `tryOptimisticRead()`: Returns a non-zero stamp if no write lock is held. This is not a real lock. You must validate it with `validate(stamp)` after reading.
 *
 * 4. Optimistic Reading Flow:
 *    a. Call `tryOptimisticRead()` to get a stamp.
 *    b. Read the shared variables.
 *    c. Call `validate(stamp)` to check if a write happened while you were reading.
 *    d. If validation fails, it means the data is dirty. You must then acquire a full read lock (`readLock()`) and read the data again.
 *
 * 5. Best Practices:
 *    - Use optimistic reads for very short, read-only operations where contention is expected to be low.
 *    - Always check the stamp from `tryOptimisticRead()` and `validate()` it.
 *    - The stamp is required for unlocking, so don't lose it.
 *    - StampedLock is not reentrant. Be careful not to cause deadlocks.
 *
 * 6. Common Pitfalls:
 *    - Forgetting to validate an optimistic read stamp.
 *    - Using the result of an optimistic read when validation fails.
 *    - Trying to acquire a lock reentrantly.
