/**
 * ExecutorService Demo - Thread Pool Management Tutorial
 *
 * INTERVIEW PREP - Key Topics:
 * =============================
 * 1. Why use ExecutorService instead of creating raw threads?
 *    - Thread reuse and pool management
 *    - Reduced overhead of thread creation/destruction
 *    - Better resource management and control
 *    - Queue-based task submission
 *
 * 2. Common Interview Questions:
 *    - Difference between execute() and submit()?
 *    - Types of thread pools: FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, SingleThreadExecutor, ScheduledThreadPool
 *    - What happens when you submit more tasks than pool size?
 *    - Explain shutdown() vs shutdownNow()
 *    - What is the difference between Runnable and Callable?
 *    - How to handle rejected execution?
 *    - What is ThreadPoolExecutor and its core parameters?
 *
 *
 * 3. Key Differences:
 *    execute(): From Executor interface, returns void, accepts only Runnable
 *    submit(): From ExecutorService, returns Future<?>, accepts Runnable or Callable
 *
 * 4. Thread Pool Types:
 *    - newFixedThreadPool(n): Fixed number of threads, unbounded queue
 *    - newCachedThreadPool(): Creates threads as needed, reuses idle threads
 *    - newSingleThreadExecutor(): Single worker thread, sequential execution
 *    - newScheduledThreadPool(n): For delayed/periodic task execution
 *
 * 5. Best Practices:
 *    - Always shutdown executor service
 *    - Use awaitTermination() to wait for tasks to complete
 *    - Handle InterruptedException properly
 *    - Consider custom ThreadPoolExecutor for fine-grained control
 *
 * 6. Common Pitfalls:
 *    - Forgetting to shutdown executor (app won't terminate)
 *    - Not handling exceptions in submitted tasks
 *    - Using unbounded queues leading to OOM
